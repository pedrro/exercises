 - Didn't you find women in IT data anywhere? Just asking, sometimes things like IBGE can help you, also some foreign entities might have that data as well
 - Even though slavery is linked with black opression, the other minorities aren't, so slavery is not the only reason, try to cite some more, and correlate them, like:
    - Black opression - Slavery, and the belief of some people that they're actually inferior in some way
    - LGBT - ???
    - Women - ???
    - Indians/Asians/Native americans - ???
    - You don't need to write a book, just tackle those reasons a little bit
