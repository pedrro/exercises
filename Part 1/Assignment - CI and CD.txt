Continuous integration , is the way to build a software making little changes and following a correct flow where all build process are automated, so, when the developer or QA made a new code/test the build will validate in the system if your code/test brokes some feature or process, this practice is very important in development process, because it reduce costs of project in maintenance of the code once that bugs are more easy to find and resolve. Continuous delivery walk together with Continuous integration because once that you have a continuous integration process implanted in your project is very easy to make deploys of your code to production and get feedbacks about it.
