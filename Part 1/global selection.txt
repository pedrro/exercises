The video of Michael Levis speaking at Princeton University is funny and I understood that money is not all, you need to detached the money and live, live doing what you need to do. The article about capitalism at India is very important to show how capitalism acts within a country, is very sad know that a million of poor people die only to quench the consumption of rich people that each time more want to stay more rich without care of consequences. Now, talking about the video from John Oliver, he talks about the injustice and the chase against the black people that happens now, in this age, in my opinion, the part of guilty is from government that donâ€™t make a good training to your police, we can see on many videos in the youtube, how unprepared police act against the street crimes, and is really terrible. Other important video that I see was about Aaron Swartz, he was fundamental to stop SOPA because he always fight against the commercialization of documents to education, once he used the MIT network to download and share a lot of documents from JSTOR. To conclude, all of this articles have a link between they, in a certain way, they talk about freedom. Michael Lewis = freedom to live, Capitalism at India = freedom to cultivate and live, John Oliver = Freedom of black people and Aaron Swartz = freedom to learn!
