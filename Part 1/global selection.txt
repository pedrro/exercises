The video of Michael Levis speaking at Princeton University is funny and I understood that money is not all, you need to detached the money and live, live doing what you need to do. The article about capitalism at India is very important to show how capitalism acts within a country, is very sad know that a million of poor people die only to quench the consumption of rich people that each time more want to stay more rich without care of consequences. Other important video that I see was about Aaron Swartz, he was fundamental to stop SOPA.
