 - English errors, try to use a automatic corrector or something
 - Sugestion - try to cite your references (not needed for this though)
 - "Which country do you think is more fair?"
    - Did you do some reasearch on this? This assignment in general is very important, it says that they expect you to expend aroung 17 hours doing it. And the answer to this question seems really weak, just citing G7, but very few data on it, or a very abstract explanation like (they ave more money so, it must be more fair)

- "Which side should India should have been on during World War II?"
    - Alright, I didn't read all the stuff from the assignments, but your explanation is very simple, did you ask yourself, what were the consequences of their choice, what were the benefits, was it a moral decision, or a more strategical/economical/political one? What are the possibilities if they had chosen the other side?
